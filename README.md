This is my personal take on d00m1k's SimpleBlueColorWaybar, adapted for the Dracula color scheme and optimized for Hyprland.

I've made several changes to the module selection and layout. Notably:

    The current window title has been replaced with a taskbar and a fixed app launcher.

    The Arch logo in the bottom-left corner launches wlogout.

    The app launcher in the tray uses Wofi.

    Clicking the volume icon opens pavucontrol.

Most other components should be self-explanatory and plug-and-play.
